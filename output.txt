Here's a detailed overview based on the information from various sources:

    Latest Developments and Human Impact:
        As of November 10, 2023, Israel agreed to four-hour daily pauses in its war on Gaza​

​.
The United Nations reported that at least 243 Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers were killed between November 8 and 9. In total, since the beginning of the conflict on October 7, about 10,812 Palestinians have been killed, including 4,412 children​

​.
Israel also launched strikes on Syria in response to a drone incident and faced attacks from Yemen’s Houthi group​

    ​.

Tactics and Responses:

    Hamas fighters have used underground tunnels to stage ambushes against Israeli tanks. Israeli military has responded by attempting to destroy these tunnels, claiming to have destroyed 130 tunnel shafts​

​.
The Israeli military's advancement into Gaza City has been met with heavy resistance from Hamas. Footage released by Hamas shows intense street battles, although the authenticity of this footage could not be independently verified​
​.

    ​.

Displacement and Civilian Hardship:

    Approximately 50,000 Palestinian civilians left the northern part of the Gaza Strip on November 8, seeking refuge from the conflict​

This situation is rapidly evolving, with significant international attention and efforts towards mediation and humanitarian aid.

It is the same during the day, except the colours are different, as Gaza’s blue skies are blackened with plumes of smoke rising from newly levelled homes.

Since the start of Israel’s latest assault on the Gaza Strip, following Hamas's surprise attack on October 7, its military has killed more than 10,500 people, at least 4,300 of whom are children. Thousands more are missing or entombed under the rubble.

Israel says it has struck at least 12,000 targets across the besieged Palestinian territory from October 7 to November 1, marking one of the most intense bombing campaigns in recent history.

Destruction equivalent of two nuclear bombs
According to the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, Israel has dropped more than 25,000 tonnes of explosives on the Gaza Strip since October 7, equivalent to two nuclear bombs.

In comparison, the Little Boy nuclear bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima during World War II yielded 15,000 tonnes of high explosives and destroyed everything within a one-mile (1.6km) radius.

Satellite imagery and photographs show entire neighbourhoods have been levelled with many hospitals, schools, places of worship and homes damaged or destroyed by Israeli land, sea and air attacks. Entire communication systems and water treatment plants have also been disabled.

According to the latest data from the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), World Health Organization (WHO) and the Palestinian government, and as of November 7, Israeli attacks have damaged at least:

Half of Gaza’s homes - 222,000 residential units damaged with more than 40,000 completely destroyed
278 educational facilities damaged
270 healthcare facilities attacked
69 places of worship damaged, including mosques and churches
45 ambulances damaged
11 bakeries destroyed
“Israel's use of ‘smart bombs’ in Gaza is part of a broader military strategy aimed at accurately targeting militant infrastructure to achieve military objectives, with no attempt to limit civilian casualties and infrastructure damage,” Elijah Magnier, a military analyst covering conflicts in the Middle East told Al Jazeera.

“The effectiveness of these weapons in achieving strategic objectives without causing disproportionate harm is impossible”, Magnier added.

Gaza is home to some 1.7 million refugees who were ethnically cleansed from areas that now form part of Israel. Most refugees live in or near Gaza’s eight densely populated refugee camps.

In the north of Gaza is one of the largest camps, Jabalia. The Israeli military has repeatedly hit the camp of some 116,000 registered refugees, on at least eight occasions - October 9, 12, 19, 22 and 31; November 1, 2 and 4 -  killing several hundred people. The camp houses three United Nations-run schools, which have been converted into shelters for hundreds of displaced families.

Hamas’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, said seven civilian hostages were killed in the attack, including three foreign passport holders.
