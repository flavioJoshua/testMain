For over a month, Gaza’s night sky has been lit by the red glow of missile flashes, delivering death and destruction to its 2.3 million residents. It is the same during the day, except the colours are different, as Gaza’s blue skies are blackened with plumes of smoke rising from newly levelled homes.\n\nSince the start of Israel’s latest assault on the Gaza Strip, following Hamas's surprise attack on October 7, its military has killed more than 10,500 people, at least 4,300 of whom are children. Thousands more are missing or entombed under the rubble.\n\nIsrael says it has struck at least 12,000 targets across the besieged Palestinian territory from October 7 to November 1, marking one of the most intense bombing campaigns in recent history.\n\n33ZT27D-highres-1699311012\nThe Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip as seen from the Israeli side of the border with the besieged enclave [Fadel Senna/AFP]\nDestruction equivalent of two nuclear bombs\nAccording to the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, Israel has dropped more than 25,000 tonnes of explosives on the Gaza Strip since October 7, equivalent to two nuclear bombs.\n\nIn comparison, the Little Boy nuclear bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima during World War II yielded 15,000 tonnes of high explosives and destroyed everything within a one-mile (1.6km) radius.\n\nThe graphic below compares the cumulative explosive power of Israel’s bombs dropped on Gaza to other powerful explosions.\nSatellite imagery and photographs show entire neighbourhoods have been levelled with many hospitals, schools, places of worship and homes damaged or destroyed by Israeli land, sea and air attacks. Entire communication systems and water treatment plants have also been disabled.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), World Health Organization (WHO) and the Palestinian government, and as of November 7, Israeli attacks have damaged at least:\n\nHalf of Gaza’s homes - 222,000 residential units damaged with more than 40,000 completely destroyed\n278 educational facilities damaged\n270 healthcare facilities attacked\n69 places of worship damaged, including mosques and churches\n45 ambulances damaged\n11 bakeries destroyed\n“Israel's use of ‘smart bombs’ in Gaza is part of a broader military strategy aimed at accurately targeting militant infrastructure to achieve military objectives, with no attempt to limit civilian casualties and infrastructure damage,” Elijah Magnier, a military analyst covering conflicts in the Middle East told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The effectiveness of these weapons in achieving strategic objectives without causing disproportionate harm is impossible”, Magnier added.\n\nGaza destruction drone shots\nThe remains of Gaza's Rimal neighbourhood [Abdelhakim Abu Riash/Al Jazeera]\nGaza is home to some 1.7 million refugees who were ethnically cleansed from areas that now form part of Israel. Most refugees live in or near Gaza’s eight densely populated refugee camps.\n\nIn the north of Gaza is one of the largest camps, Jabalia. The Israeli military has repeatedly hit the camp of some 116,000 registered refugees, on at least eight occasions - October 9, 12, 19, 22 and 31; November 1, 2 and 4 -  killing several hundred people. The camp houses three United Nations-run schools, which have been converted into shelters for hundreds of displaced families.\n\n\n\nThe Israeli military said that the attacks on Jabalia on November 1 had killed Hamas commander Ibrahim Biari whom they believe played a pivotal role in the planning and execution of the October 7 attacks on Israel.\n\nHamas’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, said seven civilian hostages were killed in the attack, including three foreign passport holders.\n\nPalestinians search for casualties a day after Israeli strikes on houses in Jabalia refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip.\nPalestinians search for casualties a day after Israeli strikes on houses in the Jabalia refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip, November 1, 2023 [Mohammed Al-Masri/Reuters]\nFollowing the strikes on the Jabalia camp, a young Palestinian boy described how he pulled a headless body from the rubble, while another man asked, “Since when has it become okay to strike shelters? This is so unfair.”\n\n
